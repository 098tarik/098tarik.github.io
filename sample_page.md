**Project description:** As busy college students, we are quite reliant on tools such as Google Calendar in order to plan our day. Even then, sometimes it becomes a chore to open up my Google Calendar and set-up an appointment every-time someone mentions a meeting or an event. With this chrome extension, the process of setting up events within Google Calendar becomes streamlined and accessible. Any user would be able to skim the most important details of their future meeting by highlighting relevant text. This is done through the user of NLP libraries and text queries. This then brings the user to a Google Calendar window where all of the relevant fields have already been filled in.
